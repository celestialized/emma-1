<%# <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve always talked about how the</span> <a href="https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/rise-audio-voice/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">future will be audio and voice focused.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same way I felt about social media in 2006/7/8, I feel about podcasting, audio and voice today in 2019. On my global top 100 iTunes podcast The GaryVee Audio Experience, you’ll hear episodes of my
favorite series called the #</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/askgaryvee"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AskGaryVee Show</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a mix of my best highlights from my</span> <a href=

current thoughts that I record specifically for this audio experience!</span></p>

<%# <p>One of the main things that has given the Internet some depth and connection is being able to communicate with voice and auido. As the future becomes the present,  the human interface leans more to audio and voice.  We all want to connect with others in a more tangible way than text can provide.</p>

<p>On <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7zkNXS6pqQPXSUnceIW4VE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The #GoCarlGo Audio Experience</a>, you’ll hear episodes of my favorite series, #AskCarlAnything Show, plus, a mix of my best highlights from my Excelsior documentary video series, live discussions on web design, interviews, fireside chats, and any of my new and current thoughts that I record specifically for this audio experience!</p> %>
